# Audio-Reactive Particle Visualizer

A simple web-based particle visualizer that reacts to microphone input.

## Features

*   Displays particles forming various geometric shapes.
*   Morphs between shapes (manually triggered or based on audio peaks).
*   Visuals respond to microphone audio levels (volume, bass, treble).
*   Customizable color schemes.
*   Selectable movement styles for particle animation.
*   Adjustable intensity for movement and brightness response.
*   Starfield background and bloom effect.

## Technology

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Three.js/WebGL, and the Web Audio API.

## How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
2.  Allow microphone access when prompted to enable audio reactivity.
3.  Use the controls at the bottom to interact with the visualizer.

## Inspiration

Inspired by the creative particle morphing work shared by Puneet | Techartist (@techartist_ on X).
